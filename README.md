# 🥗 NutriFit: Personalized Nutrition and Wellness App

## 📖 Project Overview

**NutriFit** is an all-in-one personalized nutrition and wellness mobile application that helps users maintain a healthy lifestyle by offering **budget-friendly**, **location-based**, and **science-backed** food and wellness recommendations. It aims to close the gap between health awareness and accessibility — especially in urban and rural areas where either freshness or variety is lacking.

## 💡 Problem Statement

> Many individuals struggle to access nutritious, affordable food tailored to their health goals and local availability. Urban populations face a lack of fresh produce, while rural areas often lack diversity in food options. Additionally, tracking and maintaining wellness routines requires multiple apps, leading to fragmented user experiences.
